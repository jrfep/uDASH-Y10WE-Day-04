## About uDASH

The [UNSW Data Science Hub (uDASH)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/udash) was formed to bring together data specialists from across UNSW to help address complex, real-world challenges faced by business, industry, and government. We translate large volumes of data into knowledge to support decision-making.

## About the work experience

The annual UNSW Data Science Work Experience week aims to inspire and engage students across NSW with the importance and relevance of data science to everyday life and work.

According to uDASH Director, Prof Scott Sisson:

> “The skillsets behind Data Science – maths, statistics, computer science, among others – are critical knowledge in the modern workplace. Data Science is essential to so many jobs and industries today. It’s hard to imagine a future that is not informed by data!”
